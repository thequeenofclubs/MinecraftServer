## Our server and the road to Minecraft 1.18

### Background Info
So basically, Minecraft 1.18 is the biggest update in the history of Minecraft, changing the entirety of the world generation algorithm. It basically makes it so that mountains are taller, caves are deeper, and so on. 

### But why is this important?
Well, In order to update from our lovely 1.17.1 world to 1.18, we have to hope and pray that Minecraft has some kind of conversion method so that we can keep using our world in 1.18. If not, the server is going to stay as 1.17.1 and I will open a new server on a different port that will run version 1.18. I really hope it doesnt come to that because I really want to be able to use the world we have in 1.18 and not lose the entirety of our progress.

### Okay, Great. What else?
Well, since I'm a busy boi, I havent gotten the time to write any more on this page, so you'll have to bear with me and wait probably until the end of the week for more detailed information about the update to 1.18. On this page I'll write about the modifications I'll have to make and all of the techincal stuff thats happening too.
