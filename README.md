# Server Info

### Server IP Address: 99.246.96.44

#### Version Info
The server is currently using Minecraft 1.17.1  

#### Dependencies
It's recommended to use optifine, which can be downloaded  [here](https://github.com/GabeThatGuy/MinecraftServer/raw/General-Info/Server-Resources/Optifine/OptiFine_1.17.1_HD_U_H1.jar "Download Optifine")  

The Server also uses a resource pack, which should be installed automatically by Minecraft when you join the server. If it doesn't, you can grab it [here](https://github.com/GabeThatGuy/MinecraftServer/raw/General-Info/Server-Resources/Resource%20Pack/vane-resource-pack.zip)  

#### <span style="color:blue">The server experiences planned downtime every week on Fridays at 8:00pm to conduct backups.</span>

#### Other Info
A resource pack is now required to play on the server. When joining, just click allow and it will automatically install the resource pack. It's nothing to worry about, and it won't change any textures for blocks or anything. It's for the Vane plugin to allow its features to work.  
Ha, as if we're ever going to have that many people playing, but that much overhead makes for a buttery smooth server experience.
