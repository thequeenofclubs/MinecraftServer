## Our Server's Site
On This page, you'll find out how I run this website, as well as all the juicy technical details. *Trust me, it's pretty cool stuff.*  

### Development
This site was entirely written in Markdown by Gabe. Markdown is a syntax of HTML, and it makes it much faster to code a new page, rather than having to type out all the individual html tags.  

### Hosting
This site is hosted by GitHub Pages, and the website is built from the files in the repository. Each page of this site has its own .md file in the repository and these files can be organized into folders. GitHub Pages then takes these .md files and translates them into HTML, and applies the CSS that is also stored in the repository. It's then up to me to add links to the .md files to other pages on the site.

### Why GitHub Pages?
Well, GitHub Pages is free, it's versatile, and it's run by GitHub (obviously) which makes it super easy to add files and edit them. Plus, since it's open source, it's super easy to customize and get help from other users.

### The Code
As I mentioned briefly above, the code for this site is generated based off of my inputs in raw HTML, plus my text inputs in Markdown. Here's an example of how this setup works. <span style="color:lime">Below</span> is a screenshot that shows a part of the raw code that's being displayed by your web browser.

So Yeah, now you've seen the code I enter, and considering you're reading this page, you're seeing how it gets shown to you. It's not that difficult to learn how to do but it makes for quite a fun time because you have all the power of HTML without any website builder apps like Wix or Squarespace. Just you, the code, and the result. As soon as I make a change in Markdown, it instantly gets updated on the site. (*Okay, maybe not instantly, but hey 30 seconds isn't exactly slow*)
