## Our Server's Crafting Recipes
*What would Minecraft be without crafting?*  

Recipes on this page will be sorted by plugin name.  

### Vane
Okay, so, Vane's documentation is pretty terrible as far as crafting recipes go, so I'll do my best to update this page as I discover more about how the plug-in works.  

#### Tools
- Sickle
  - In order to craft a sickle: you'll need: 3 of any tool item (Diamond, Iron, etc..) and one stick, arranged as follows:

  - In order to craft a file, you'll need: one of any tool item, and one stick, arranged as follows/

#### Enchantments

In Vane, enchantments are based off of three kinds of Tomes:  
- Ancient Tome
- Ancient Tome of Knowledge
- Ancient Tome of the Gods

Different Tomes are used depending on the rarity of the enchantment you're going for. You'll see what I mean later.

##### Ancient Tome:
Ancient Tomes are found in chests scattered across the world, such as abandoned mineshaft chests or desert temple chests.

##### Ancient Tome of Knowledge
The Ancient Tome of knowledge can be crafted as follows:
