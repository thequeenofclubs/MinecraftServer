## Vane Portals Guide
So, here's the guide on how to use Vane's Portal system.

### What You'll Need
In order to build a portal with Vane, you'll need the following:
- One Netherite Block
- One Enchantment Table
- One Lever
- Some Obsidian for building the frame.


### Constructing the Portal
Firstly, take your netherite block and place it in the ground (recessed). This will serve as the place where the player spawns when walking or running through the portal.  
Next, build any shape of frame with the obsidian that is three blocks tall or higher. Make sure that the netherite block is incorporated into the frame.  
Then, take your enchantment table and place it nearby. Then, take your lever and place the lever on one of the portal frame blocks. Then follow the ingame instructions on how to set up the portal. In order to link the portal to the console, shift-click on the enchantment table and then right-click on the portal.  
And that's it! Your portal is set up and ready to use, just click on the console, choose a destination, and walk through!
