## The Core
On this page, you'll find info about our server's core. 

### The Basis
Our server is based on [<span style="color:red">Paper</span>](http://papermc.io), which is a high-performance fork of CraftBukkit.  
Paper allows for more responsive loading of chunks, and can handle more players at once which reduces our ping. It also allows for [plugins](/MinecraftServer/wiki/plugins) for additional features!

### Hardware & Software
The server runs on a Dell XPS 15 with the following specifications
- CPU: Intel Core i7-10875H @ 5.1 GHz
- 32 GB RAM
- NVidia GeForce GTX 1650-Ti
- Runs Ubuntu and [VSH](https://thequeenofclubs.github.io/VSH)
- 97 Wh battery allows for up to 10 hours of runtime in case of power outage.
#### Why Ubuntu?
Ubuntu is used on the server because it allows for remote management of files, updates, server information, and more over the internet. This allows Valerie to manage the server from anywhere in the world, and conveniently update it as needed.

It also allows the server to run as a service, meaning the server runs 24/7 and restarts automatically in case of a power outage.
