## OptiFine & The Server
### Background Info: Server Compatibility
The server is designed to be compatible with Vanilla Minecraft, OptiFine and Sodium Renderers, and Minecraft Forge (although any mods you have installed will not work). 

### Why use OptiFine?
Optifine, like Sodium, is a renderer that replaces the vanilla renderer with one that has more customization and more. Typically, users who switch to OptiFine can expect a 100-150% FPS increase, as well as support for connected textures, shaders, handheld lighting, and more.
