## Essentials
This plugin is the **backbone** of our server. It's what makes things tick.  
Essentials enables things like tick monitoring, memory management, warps, shortened commands, different weather patterns, as well as many other game rules.

## <span style="color:darkviolet">Vane</span>
Vane is one of the biggest plugins on our server. It adds quality of life improvements, new items, new enchantments, and portals.  
#### More detailed information on <span style="color:darkviolet">Vane</span> can be found [<span style="color:red">here.</span>](/MinecraftServer/wiki/vane-detailed)  

## WorldEdit
WorldEdit is mostly for admin and troubleshooting on our server, but it lets you do some cool stuff like hollowing out areas or constructing giant pillars. More info is in the [commands](/MinecraftServer/wiki/commands) section of the wiki.

## OpenInv
Allows server administrators to view the inventories of other players.

## LuckPerms
To manage permissions for different members, as well as to fix unwanted behaviour from plugins.

## SimpleRename
A simple plugin to rename things via commands.

## ViaVersion
Allows players to join from different Minecraft Versions. Our server supports versions 1.7.x - 1.20.4.

## Geyser, Waterfall and Floodgate
Allows players to join the server from bedrock edition clients even if they do not own Minecraft Java Edition

## CoordinatesHUD
CoordinatesHUD is a useful plugin that displays the player's coordinates on the screen. This is particularly helpful for players who need to navigate through the world or share specific locations with others. The plugin enhances the gameplay experience by providing essential location information at a glance.

## DeadChest
DeadChest is a plugin that stores the contents of player's in a chest upon death. Players can then teleport to that location when they die and retrieve their items. This serves as a middle ground between ``keepInventory`` and the vanilla behaviour, since players still have to make their way back to where they died, without having to worry about their items despawning.


## Multiverse
Multiverse is a plugin that allows for the creation of multiple worlds within the same server instance. This is useful for creating separate game modes or environments for players to explore. For example, you can create a world for survival players to explore, and a world for creative players to build their own worlds.

## Pl3xMap
Pl3xMap is a plugin that allows players to view the world map from a web browser. This is particularly useful for players who need to navigate through the world or share specific locations with others.
